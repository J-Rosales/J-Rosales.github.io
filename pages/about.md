# **About Me**

Hello!
I am **{{ site.author.name }}**, but I go by Cryomancerlex in most things online.<br>
I'm an indie developer from MÃ©xico, looking to make fun and mechanically engaging games as my main goal. Then, if resources permit, I want to go the extra mile and imbue them with a healthy and sincere view of our world history and society. Post-meta-quasi-whathaveyou-irony and deconstruction gets tiring after a while and does not build a better future.
